2. For milestone 2, we keep the same idea as our milestone 1 to create a recipe website for vegan and vegetarian. However, 
we consider to increase its social aspect for our next milestone and add more features, such as picture sharing,
voting, commenting, and leading board. 

4. The screenshot of our home page is different from our paper prototype since we implemented a 
sign in and a log in option on the homepage rather than on the landing page. We decided to remove the 
professional cookbook and replaced it with all personal homemade recipes. 
By doing so, users can upload their creative homemade-recipes and share with others. 
Users can also vote, react, and comment on each otherâ€™s recipes.
The screenshot of our recipe page is also slightly different from our paper prototype in terms of its layout.
